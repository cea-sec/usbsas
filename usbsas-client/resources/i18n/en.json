    "faqr1": "USBSAS is a tool to securely transfer files between a potentially malicious USB device and a trusted one. It implements secure mechanisms at different levels (USB, SCSI, filesystems etc.) and files are analyzed by multiple antivirus",
    "faqr2": "First, plug the input device, then the output one (which will be completely erased) or select the destination network. Next you will be able to browse and select files from the input device. Start the copy and wait for the end of the transfer",
    "faqr3": "USBSAS is able to read USB thumb drives and external hard disks of type Mass Storage. Supported filesystems are FAT, exFAT, NTFS, ISO9660 and ext4",
    "faqr4": "No. USBSAS isn't a simple antivirus, it also offers protections against exploitation of USB, SCSI, FAT etc. stacks. Moreover, a malicious USB device could detect being plugged on an antivirus station and only show clean files while showing malwares on a workstation.",
    "faqr5": "Device wipe: USBSAS can wipe and reformat your USB device; Disk imaging: You can make an image disk of your device for the administrators to analyze later.",
